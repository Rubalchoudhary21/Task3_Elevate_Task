# üîê Password Strength Evaluation Project

---

## üìå Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, evaluate password security using multiple online tools, and document findings to improve awareness of secure password practices.

This project aims to:
- Analyze how **length, complexity, and unpredictability** affect password strength.
- Learn to identify weak passwords and avoid common pitfalls.
- Evaluate passwords using **industry-recognized tools**.
- Understand **attack techniques** (brute force, dictionary attacks) and how to defend against them.
- Develop practical skills for assessing and improving password hygiene.

## üîß Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) for checking exposure in breaches.

## üìã Steps Performed

1. **Created Multiple Passwords**
   - Generated 5 passwords ranging from **very simple** to **highly complex**.
   - Example formats tested:
     - `password123`
     - `Summer2024`
     - `S!mpl3P@ss`
     - `Tr0ub4dor&3`
     - `x9Qv#72lF!r$eKz1`

2. **Applied Password Best Practices**
   - Used combinations of:
     - Uppercase and lowercase letters
     - Numbers
     - Special characters
     - Lengths varying between 8 and 20+ characters

3. **Tested Passwords Using Online Tools**
   - Collected:
     - Strength scores
     - Estimated cracking times
     - Security recommendations
   - Compared results across different tools to see consistency.

4. **Noted Observations**
   - Short or dictionary-based passwords were rated **weak** and crackable in seconds.
   - Longer, mixed-character passwords were rated **strong** with estimated cracking times in **centuries**.

5. **Studied Common Attack Types**
   - **Brute Force:** Trying every possible combination.
   - **Dictionary Attack:** Trying known words and leaked passwords.
   - **Credential Stuffing:** Reusing stolen passwords across services.

6. **Summarized Findings**
   - Passwords should be:
     - At least **12‚Äì16 characters** long.
     - Unpredictable and unique for every account.
     - Stored securely (e.g., with a password manager).

## üìä Sample Findings Table

| Password Example  | Score (Avg) | Estimated Time to Crack      | Notes                                   |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `password123`     | Weak        | <1 second                    | Common dictionary word + numbers       |
| `Summer2024`      | Weak        | <2 minutes                   | Predictable pattern                    |
| `S!mpl3P@ss`      | Moderate    | ~4 hours                     | Still partially predictable            |
| `Tr0ub4dor&3`     | Strong      | ~15 years                    | Good complexity                        |
| `x9Qv#72lF!r$eKz1`| Very Strong | Centuries                    | Excellent length & randomness          |

## üõ°Ô∏è Tips for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use **at least 12‚Äì16 characters**.
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid personal information, dictionary words, and predictable patterns.
- Never reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- Consider using a **trusted password manager** (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password).
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** wherever possible.
